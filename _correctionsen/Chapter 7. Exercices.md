# Chapter 7 : Power transmission by low-compressibility fluids

  
 
## 7.1.1. Rigid pipe


#### 1)	It is then preferable to model the pipe as :

Answer : **d)** One restriction only - R elements


#### 2) Choose the most appropriate pipe modeling :

Answer : **d)** Several R, C and I assemblies in series

## 7.1.2. Hydraulic actuator chamber

#### 1) What equation represents :

  - The transformation of effort / pressure:  **a**
  - The flow / speed transformation:  **a**
  - The compressibility of the fluid: **None**
  - External hydraulic leaks: **None**

#### 2) What is the sign convention associated with the flow at the hydraulic port ? 

**a)** a positive flow rate is equivalent to a positive piston speed
