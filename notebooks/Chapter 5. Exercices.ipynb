    "#### 1) Write the dynamic equation of the motion of the object for the two configurations. The position of the mass is denoted by $x$ and for each configuration the positive direction is taken as indicated in figure 5.36.b and c. For each configuration, the origin of the system of coordinates is located on the electromagnet.\n",

    "\n",
    "The square on the current and the position, the division between these two and the sum with a constant are nonlinear functions.\n",

    "#### 4) The focus is now on vertical motions of the mass around its equilibrium position $x_{eq}$. Show that the linearization of the system around the equilibrium  ($i_{eq},\\, x_{eq}$) gives the differential equation $\\ddot{\\Delta x}=\\alpha\\Delta i+\\beta\\Delta x$ where $\\Delta i$ is the current variation around the rated hold current $i_{eq}$ and $\\Delta x$ is the variation of the position of the object around $x_{eq}$. Find the analytical expressions of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for these two configurations.\n",
